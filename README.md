# List of courses related to GEN AI

1. [Introduction to Generative AI by Google Cloud](https://partner.cloudskillsboost.google/journeys/119)
        
        1. This gives a high level overview on Generative AI covers below topics
            - Introduction to GenAI
            - LLMs
            - Google's responsible AI principles
            - Transformers
            - Introductory Lab's on Vertex AI (GCP's Powerful ML and AI platform)
2. [Generative AI with LLMs By DeepLearning.AI](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-with-llms/) 

               This course can help you to understand the complexity of LLMs with handson by using related python libraries. 
                    Generative AI lifecycle and handson labs on AWS Sagemaker is covered.

            - Transformers architecture. how encoding, decoding used
                applicartions like speech to text, language translation, task completion.
            - Different types of prompts to improve the model response
            - Compute and GPU optimisation techniques
            - Tuning methods
            - Reinforcement learning with Human feedback
            - How to train and validate LLM's against pretrained models. In this lab they have taken 
                Hugging face datasets and FLANT-5 LLM model 
            - Python modules 
3. [Generative AI with Google - Bard, PaLM API and Google Cloud](https://www.udemy.com/course/generative-ai-with-google-bard-google-cloud/)

              - This course is more specific towards explaning google cloud services related to AI ML (VERTEX AI),
                      Including API invocation of pretrained ML and Language models into applications
              - An overview of Machine learning algorithms also covered.
   There are few other courses which are useful to learn Vertex AI mentioned below
